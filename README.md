#Tribute-to-Kim-Mee-soo

Note :- The background music is from  JTBC's *Snowdrop* K-Drama named "Destiny".

As a beginner in web development,
I'm practicing HTML and CSS to increase interest.

I have created this simple tribute page of my beloved/favourite actress who passed away. After hearing/watching this heart-wrenching incident, I became very sad and didn't even feel like doing anything. It has been made after a lot of effort.
