#Tribute-to-Kim-Mee-soo

As a beginner in web development,
I'm practicing HTML and CSS to increase interest.

I have created this simple tribute page of my beloved/favourite actress who passed away. After hearing/seeing the shocking news, I became very sad and I didn't even feel like doing anything. After a lot of courage, it was made.
